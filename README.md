# Strategic Market Analysis for EV Startup Manufacturing

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **electric vehicle (EV) sales data from 2016 to 2024** across different vehicle categories. The goal is to help **EV startup manufacturers** make data-driven decisions before setting up production. 

We performed **market segmentation** using **K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** clustering to identify the most promising vehicle segments. This analysis helps startups determine **the best cluster to target** for maximum profitability and strategic growth.  


## Key Findings
- **Cluster 2 (High-Growth Mass Market):** The **2-Wheeler (NT)** and **3-Wheeler (T)** segments have the highest sales and growth potential, making them ideal for **startup investment**.  
- **Cluster 0 (Stable Performance):** The **Light Goods Vehicles (LGV)** segment shows **steady growth**, making it a **strategic** choice for **commercial transport solutions**.  
- **Cluster 1 (Emerging Niche):** This segment has **low growth potential**, requiring **minimal investment** unless market conditions improve.  

## Strategic Recommendations
Startups should **prioritize high-growth and stable markets**, focusing on **product innovation, competitive pricing, and fleet expansion** while cautiously **monitoring emerging niches**.  

## âš™Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (PCA, K-Means Clustering)  
- **Data Visualization**
